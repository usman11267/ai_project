AI Project 
This project integrates an AI-powered backend with a web-based frontend to provide intelligent assistance, likely in the domain of Pakistani medicine, as suggested by the included dataset.

Project Structure
main.py: The primary entry point for the backend application.

agent.py: Contains the AI agent logic, possibly utilizing LangChain or similar frameworks.

frontend/: Holds the frontend application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

pakistani_medicine_dataset.csv: A dataset that may be used for training or referencing within the AI model.

package.json & package-lock.json: Define the Node.js dependencies for the frontend.

.env: Environment variables for configuration (ensure this file is not committed to version control).

Technologies Used
Backend: Python

Frontend: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

AI Frameworks: Potentially LangChain or similar (based on the presence of agent.py)
